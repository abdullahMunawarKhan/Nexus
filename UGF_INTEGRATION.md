UGF (Universal Gas Framework) Integration Guide
Overview

UGF (Universal Gas Framework) enables blockchain transactions without requiring users to hold ETH for gas fees.

In our Nexus donation platform, UGF will be used to allow donors to contribute using MockUSD while UGF handles transaction execution on Base Sepolia.

This removes blockchain onboarding friction and creates a beginner-friendly donation experience.

How UGF Changes Our Current Flow
Traditional Web3 Flow (Current)

Current donation flow requires ETH:

User connects wallet
User approves MockUSD spending
User calls donation function
User pays ETH gas for approval
User pays ETH gas for donation

Problem:

Two transactions
Two gas payments
Bad UX
Not aligned with hackathon objective
Updated UGF Flow (Target)

New flow:

User connects wallet
User selects campaign
User enters donation amount
Frontend prepares donation transaction data
UGF generates execution quote
User approves MockUSD payment
UGF executes donation transaction on Base Sepolia
Smart contract records donation
Frontend updates campaign dashboard

Result:
User donates without needing ETH.

Implementation Steps
1. Install UGF SDK

Frontend installation:

npm install @tychilabs/react-ugf

Alternative lower-level SDK:

npm install @tychilabs/ugf-testnet-js

Recommended:
Use @tychilabs/react-ugf for easier integration.

2. Keep Existing Wallet Integration

Existing stack remains:

RainbowKit
wagmi
viem

Wallet is still required for:

user identity
transaction signing
payment approval

UGF only removes ETH gas dependency.

3. Create UGF Service Layer

Create:

frontend/src/lib/ugf.js

Responsibilities:

initialize UGF SDK
generate quotes
execute transactions
handle errors

Example functions:

getDonationQuote()
executeDonationWithUGF()
handleUGFError()
4. Prepare Smart Contract Call Data

UGF needs encoded transaction data.

Target smart contract functions (two options):

**Option A: Traditional (requires ETH)**
- `donateToCampaign(campaignId, amount, message)`

**Option B: Permit-based (Recommended for UGF - No ETH needed!)**
- `donateToCampaignWithPermit(campaignId, amount, message, deadline, v, r, s)`

Frontend will encode this call using ABI.

Example for permit-based:
```javascript
encodeFunctionData({
  abi: DonationABI,
  functionName: "donateToCampaignWithPermit",
  args: [campaignId, amount, message, deadline, v, r, s]
})
```

This encoded data is passed to UGF.

**Why Option B is better:**
- Single transaction instead of two
- Uses EIP-2612 Permit for off-chain approval
- UGF can execute the transaction, so donor doesn't need ETH

5. Replace Traditional Donation Logic

Old flow:

approve()
donate()

Remove this donor flow.

Replace with:

handleDonateWithUGF()

New flow:

prepare transaction data
request UGF quote
show fee confirmation
approve MockUSD payment
execute via UGF
return transaction hash
Donation Execution Flow
Step 1

User clicks Donate

Step 2

Frontend collects:

campaign ID
donation amount
optional message
Step 3

Frontend encodes donation transaction

Step 4

UGF generates execution quote

Example:

Donation Amount: 50 MockUSD
Execution Fee: 0.25 MockUSD
Total: 50.25 MockUSD
Step 5

User confirms payment

Step 6

UGF executes transaction remotely

UGF handles:

gas fees
transaction submission
blockchain execution
Step 7

Smart contract updates:

raised amount
donation history
donor record
Step 8

Frontend displays:

Donation Successful
Transaction Hash
View on Base Explorer
Frontend Files Involved
Existing

Wallet setup:

frontend/src/lib/web3.jsx

Donation UI:

UGF service:

Smart Contract Requirements

Donation contract must support:

donateToCampaign(campaignId, amount, message)

OR (Recommended)
donateToCampaignWithPermit(campaignId, amount, message, deadline, v, r, s)

Current contract already supports both!

It uses ERC20 token donation with transferFrom() and also supports EIP-2612 Permit.

### Token Choice: Use TYI_MOCK_USD
- **Recommended**: Use TYI_MOCK_USD as both donation token and UGF settlement token
- **No custom MockUSD contract needed** - huge simplification!
- Donation contract accepts any ERC20 in constructor - just pass TYI_MOCK_USD address


Immediate Development Priority

Before full frontend integration:

Build a simple test button:

Test UGF Donation

Goal:

Successful Base Sepolia donation transaction through UGF.

Only after this works:
proceed with full donation UI.

Expected Outcome

Final donor experience:

Connect wallet
Choose campaign
Enter donation amount
Approve MockUSD payment
Donation succeeds

No ETH required.

Key Benefit

This aligns directly with hackathon requirements:

beginner-friendly dApp
no ETH gas dependency
practical blockchain use case
smooth Web3 UX
